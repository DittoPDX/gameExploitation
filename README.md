Age of Empires II HD Steam

## Exploiting Method Approach
- Decipher the calling convention : _thiscall
- Decode the parameters (if any)
- Create a function pointer with user parameters, then call the function
- Process is done via DLL injection

## Analysis as of 09/XX/2017
- Game engine uses a switch statement plus register calculations to get to the correct cheat
- With the _thiscall calling convention, we need to either decipher the game structures or pass in a dummy struct
